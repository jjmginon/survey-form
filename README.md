## Project Description

This project is based on what I built in **[freeCodeCamp's Certification Project: Build a Survey Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form)**. It passes all the user stories required by the certification project while ensuring semantic HTML and organized CSS.

The survey form collects customer feedback, including their overall satisfaction, aspects they are most satisfied with, areas for improvement, and additional comments.

## Features

- **Personal Information Collection**: Fields for optional name, email, and age.
- **Satisfaction Rating**: Options for users to rate satisfaction levels from "Very Satisfied" to "Very Dissatisfied".
- **Satisfaction Aspect**: Dropdown for users to specify which aspect of the service they're most satisfied with (Customer Service, Product Quality, Pricing, Delivery).
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Checkbox options for users to indicate areas needing improvement (Customer Service, Product Quality, Pricing, Delivery, Website Usability).
- **Comments Section**: A textarea for users to leave additional comments and suggestions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic elements for better accessibility and readability.
- **CSS3**: Organized and modular styling rules for a clean and responsive design.
- **Google Fonts**: Integration of "Open Sans" font for a modern look.
- **Flexbox**: For flexible and consistent layout across different devices.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure and content of the survey form.
- `css/styles.css`: CSS file for styling the survey form.

## Customization

### Changing the Theme

To customize the look and feel of the survey form, you can modify the `css/styles.css` file. Here are some examples of what you can change:

- **Font & Colors**: The CSS file uses the "Open Sans" font via Google Fonts and specifies various colors. You can change these to match your branding.
- **Layout & Spacing**: The utility classes and general styles can be adjusted to change the layout and spacing of elements.
- **Form Controls**: Customize the appearance of form controls (e.g., input fields, buttons) by adjusting the CSS rules.
